These files comprise the ESL compiler front-end.  The back end is LLVM.

To bootstrap a ESL front-end on an x86 or x86-64 Linux system:

1. Install LLVM, let the directory in which the executables llc, opt, and llvm-as
   reside be DIR.

2. The gcc development system must also be installed, only the assembler,
   linker, and, lowlevel libraries are used.

3. cd src/

4. Edit the shell file "llvm" to reflect where the LLVM programs reside
   (i.e., DIR).
   Edit the Makefile to indicate which architecture to target.

5. Type "make boot"
   If successful, identical copies of a the compiler are left in
   "eslc2" and "eslc3"

6. A 32-bit compiler can be built by typing "make".
   A 64-bit x86 compiler can built by typing "make eslc-x86-64"
